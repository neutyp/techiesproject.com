    The project has two main goals: to show the outside world a more comprehensive picture of people who work in tech, and to bring a bit of attention to folks in the industry whose stories have never been heard, considered or celebrated. We believe storytelling is a powerful tool for social impact and positive change." />

    <p><b>Why don&#8217;t we start from the very beginning. Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m from Colorado. I grew up in Colorado Springs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mom is a doctor and a single mom. How do I describe my upbringing? Colorado Springs is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">famous for like “Focus on the Family” and super conservative Christians. But I wasn&#8217;t exposed to any of that, I just had my mom, her medical practice, and all her doctor friends. The problem </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with this question is that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got poisoned as a child, so I don&#8217;t remember anything from before </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably thirteen. I have forgotten most of my life actually, I found out recently my husband and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a wedding that I don’t remember. There are pictures and everything.</span></p>
<p><b>Holy shit.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So my whole childhood is basically gone. My mom remembers, you can ask her if you want </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[laugh]. The primary answer to that question is I don&#8217;t know, because it&#8217;s gone, all that stuff is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just gone. I know I have two brothers and a sister, but I don&#8217;t have a lot of anecdotal things from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">childhood, or even more recently, because it&#8217;s just not in my brain anymore. My memory, if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can call it that, is stored entirely in a combination of other people and various kinds of recordings.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">I got poisoned as a child, so I don&#8217;t remember anything from before </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably thirteen.

There are pictures and everything.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>So, if you feel comfortable, what happened?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On my tenth birthday, my family­­ so my mom and my little brother, me and then I think two </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">friends, I don&#8217;t know, some small group of people went to a hotel that had a pool to do ten-year-old birthday things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the hotel was negligent on their maintenance or something, I don&#8217;t remember. There was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit, I never read the findings, I was too young. So they were negligent and carbon monoxide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and chlorine gas and some other gases leaked into the pool area, and my mom and my little </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brother and me and both my friends were poisoned. But my mom and I got the worst effects, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were poisoned the most. So, my mom and I went from being totally normal to having traumatic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brain injuries, but by poison instead of war or football or whatever.</span></p>
<p><b>How did those injuries manifest in the early years, and how is it continuing to?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has changed over the years. Gotten better and worse. I get attacks of uncontrollable shaking. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My body is usually in pain. I get a ton of migraines, a fuck ton actually. My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proprioception</a>, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is like, the accurate sensation of where your body is in space, and the position you&#8217;re in is 80 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">percent gone which means my balance and walking have good and bad days. I am basically a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">grab bag of neurological issues: Alice in Wonderland Syndrome to Post-­traumatic Stress </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disorder. It’s hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I seemed to improve slowly until I was in college, but then when my brain was under stress I got </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bad relapse. So I guess my junior year in college I was all way back at the bottom. I couldn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">walk, I was having migraines everyday, I shook constantly. After that I was really bad for several </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">years and I&#8217;ve been inching my way back out of that hole ever since.</span></p>
<p><b>What about your mom?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mom, you would describe her as like a stroke victim. Even though that&#8217;s not what happened, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that&#8217;s a thing people understand. She basically got a migraine for 8 years straight. She is doing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">much better now. Still dealing but better.</span></p>
<p><b>Wow. So you probably don’t remember but, as a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up­­?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mom says I wanted to be a surgeon, which I am now like, &#8220;That is the most ridiculous thing I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">could have ever thought of.&#8221; But, of course that&#8217;s what I wanted to do. My mom was a doctor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and her medical practice was very integrated into our lives so of course I wanted to do </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">medicine. I think my initial &#8220;I&#8217;m going to college&#8221; was pre­-med, until I figured out about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chemistry. I was like, &#8220;ugh, this is horrible.&#8221; Chemistry is the worst. Or at least that’s what I like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to tell myself. That I had a choice, that I opted out instead of what really happened which is that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was forced out by my disability.</span></p>
<p><b>Did you have any idea at that time that you&#8217;d end up in Silicon Valley tech?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. My BFA is in Theater, Film, and Television Production, so I thought I was going to go into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theater. But I got so sick at the end of school that all of my best laid plans were totally ruined. I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was supposed to go work as an assistant stage manager in Tokyo. But I was too sick, there was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">no way I could take that job, or any job.</span></p>
<p><b>So walk me through the winding road that took you to VR.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So after college I was essentially on bed­rest for four years. I shouldn&#8217;t say bed­rest. I was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">home­bound for four years. Walking to the bathroom made me dizzy so I crawled kinda thing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in that time, I started watching <a href="http://www.pbs.org/art21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art21</a>, which is this contemporary art show made by PBS. It&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">so fucking good. It’s a collection of artists talking about their work and their lives and their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">families and it changed my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was laying there on the couch at 20 thinking that this painful bullshit was what the rest of my </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">life was going to be like, and I decided, “Fuck it I’m gonna steal ideas from these people.” So I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">starting copying their work. Andrea Zittel and Ann Hamilton and Vija Celmins and Kara Walker. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These women became my pantheon. Oh and Janine Antoni, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janine_Antoni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janine Antoni</a>! She&#8217;s amazing! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s from the Bahamas and she would place a tightrope right at the horizon and then she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would walk across the tightrope on video and every time she took a step the line would just </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">touch the horizon. So good. She also hand spun this huge rope with all these video tapes and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clothes and just any material donated from her friends and family. Antoni made a rope so I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made a rope. Zittel crocheted so I crocheted. Hamilton talked about social concepts in cloth so I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">talked about computational concepts in cloth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I copied lots of work from Art21 because there was nothing else to do. It was just not what you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to happen right after you get out of college. Like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get an internship, and I&#8217;ll be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">out every night and­­—No. You&#8217;re going to lay in bed for four years and be bored.” That was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically the start of like, &#8220;I am an artist now.&#8221; The art was my entire life at that point, I guess it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">still is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I finally made my own work it was these brightly­-colored abstract crocheted sculptures the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">size of, ironically, the couch I’d been stuck on. I guess the first time I really showed anything </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was in 2009, with the Armory Show in New York.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was told my thesis work wasn’t art because I made a video game. It wasn’t even a game it was an interactive environment that addressed the contemporary way that we go about knowledge formation. They couldn’t see it. It was weird because I was interested in technology. The work that I was making before, the crochet, was about reenacting computational systems. But they had never seen that either, those works were talked about as “heroic women’s work”. It drove me crazy. The professors never could see crochet as data, as captured information in the shape of a linear thread. But I still graduated, so fuck them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><b>*Just* the Armory? [laughter]</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah me and galleries have never been much of a thing. Then I used that work, and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">credential of that show to apply to grad school. I went to the California College of the Arts over </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on Potrero Hill. That was the first time I was really out of the house everyday by myself in years. I was 24.</span></p>
<p>Some of it was great. I found a couple professors that were awesome.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should come as no surprise that I did not fit in well at school. I had just spent 4 years alone with the exception of my boyfriend. I didn&#8217;t know how to human and I was learning to be disabled not just at home in a bubble of my own control but at the school, in classes, on the train etc. Once again I have very few anecdotes of grad school, what with my memory but I know it was both great and really stupid. I got really tough and focused because of school. I am a much better artist now, and I found one professor who I am friends with today who is brilliant and funny and really important to me. But because I wasn&#8217;t great at interacting with the other students, so they started calling me The Borg. They were like, &#8220;But it&#8217;s endearing because we like you,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s socially separating and bullying.&#8221; But they never stopped. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was told my thesis work wasn’t art because I made a video game. It wasn’t even a game it was an interactive environment that addressed the contemporary way that we go about knowledge formation. They couldn’t see it.

But they had never seen that either, those works were talked about as “heroic women’s work”. It drove me crazy. The professors never could see crochet as data, as captured information in the shape of a linear thread. But I still graduated, so fuck them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what happened after that? I got my first job. I was so proud of myself. I worked as an architectural assistant making drawings and writing their blog. I worked there until she couldn&#8217;t afford to pay me anymore. Then I started working for Axis dance company and they&#8217;re in Oakland and they&#8217;re physically integrated dance company and I worked there for almost two years, man, what I thought at the time was going to be a dream job turned out to be awful. Anyway I also wrote for KQED in there, writing about net art, the internet, and video games mostly, and I was doing a lot of both digital drawing and ink on paper which both turned into making gifs and prints and comic books. It was around that time, in 2013, I started making YouTube videos too. Again copying existing work I liked from Mike Rugnetta and PBS Idea Channel. Huh, twice now PBS has been foundational to my art. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The videos started as talking head style technology and cultural criticism pieces plastered with wild editing. It was a great way to restart with video. I had experience editing short films and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">features from college but the show, self-titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlinkPopShift</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also leaned hard on the writing and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">research skills I forged at grad school and KQED. It became a way to think across tech and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">culture and art and science the same way I had been exploring in my masters thesis, but now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone, not just the limited pov’s of my professors, could see the result. Simultaneously I built </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a whole body of work exclusively on my phone, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still Lives</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series, using a combination of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">photogrammetry and various gif making apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I became super immersed in Youtube so I went to <a href="http://vidcon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vidcon</a> and met Mike Rugnetta and Vi Hart </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Malia Moss who all turned out to amazing friends and collaborators. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few months later I got a call from Vi asking “Hey, do you think you could build a VR camera?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah sure, I don&#8217;t see why not. That doesn&#8217;t seem that hard.&#8221; And I was right, I mean it took months of work and cameras melting and trial and error and math but I did it.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A few months later I got a call from Vi asking “Hey, do you think you could build a VR camera?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;Yeah sure, I don&#8217;t see why not. That doesn&#8217;t seem that hard.&#8221; And I was right, I mean it took months of work and cameras melting and trial and error and math but I did it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So you just&#8230; made a VR camera?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, yeah. We, along with Andrea Hawksley, the three horsemen of eleVR, have been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">working on various projects in VR, AR, and mixed reality every since. Vi’d hired me to work at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the then Communications Design Group, Alan Kay’s Research Lab at SAP. Working for an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open lab is great because with no pressure to publish traditional papers, we can write up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything on our blog for anyone to read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to say I was so happy when fully spherical, auto-stitching cameras came on the market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and I didn&#8217;t have to actually build them by hand with a fucking hot glue gun anymore, which was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fun but also so tedious. I focus on studying how immersion works and how aesthetic techniques </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">communicate to viewers. Recently I’ve been building the foundation of spherical </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cinematography so I can use that knowledge when designing immersive web systems.</span></p>
<p><b>What excites you about that space?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making hybrid reality projects where linkages are no longer limited to computers and screens. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I write or make art, I like to put stuff everywhere but computers in their current conception </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t allow for creative messes. Sure, you can barf icons all over your desktop, but that&#8217;s not a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">creative mess. It feels heavy and in need of “organization.” Good messes feed my creativity </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">through serendipity and flexibility. But my physical messes don’t have search for when I know </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly which bit of red paper has to go on the collage next. That divide between the physical </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the digital will close, ‘cause me and my vice grip say so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that also means taking seriously the considerations of what the body wants. Because like, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we are not fingers with eyes and ear holes. The way we do knowledge creation has a lot to do </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with this flappy meat thing. We completely disregard its wants and needs and its ideas about the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">world for what, a touch screen? This is the most embodied form of computational media that we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have? Pinch and zoom and swipe and tap? Gross. There&#8217;s so much touch you can&#8217;t get in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">little rectangles we carry around everywhere, it drives me crazy.</span></p>

<p><b>What is it like straddling two worlds—art and tech—that often feel at odds with each other?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At work, I don&#8217;t feel at odds because like they specifically set up the lab for that kind of cross </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">disciplinary flexibility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am the most traditionally “visual art” person there, which I find funny </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">since in grad school I was the most “tech” person, but being a weird inbetweener is kinda our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thing at the lab. But when I&#8217;m out of my bubble it&#8217;s really hard because my work, and probably </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">my personality too, is hard to parse as either or, as art or tech, as artist or researcher. A good </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">example is that I don’t go to VR meetups any more. Everyone was too newness focused. There </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was no bubbling curiosity, no juicy conversation. It was just, sorry to say it but, a bunch of white </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dudes being boring.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ugh, tech Industry problems.</span></p>
<p><b>What are the biggest motivators behind your work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I make art for two people, which people do not like to hear, but it&#8217;s true. I make sculpture for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Sedlmayr, my husband, who is such a fucking treasure, we’re 12 years this summer, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I make video for Vi Hart, who is one of my best friends and my boss. That&#8217;s it. The sculptural </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">work is for him and the video work is for her. When I can make either of them tilt their head or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">think &#8220;What is that?&#8221; or smile or laugh or say “Yes. More please,” that&#8217;s winning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is definitely a subtle pressure from social media to care about a bigger audience and I do </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a small audience online. Some people watch the videos online, and some people read the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stuff that I publish, and that&#8217;s great but I don&#8217;t crave their opinions. For me, seeing Vi watch a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">video and afterward be like, &#8220;Damn!&#8221; That&#8217;s my chocolate sundae.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am the most traditionally “visual art” person there, which I find funny </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">since in grad school I was the most “tech” person, but being a weird inbetweener is kinda our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thing at the lab.

<p><b>I think it&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve miraculously managed to achieve something that I&#8217;m just starting to achieve—the “art of giving no fucks.” </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it&#8217;s absolutely pivotal—or giving exactly the right fucks. You&#8217;re going to give a fuck about someone’s opinion, but just give it to exactly the right ones. My husband, he is also an artist. He makes games now but he knows a lot about sculpture and is really interested in sculpture. Making a sculpture for him is so powerful and awesome and his feedback really pushes me. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t give no fucks, just give the right ones.</span></i></p>
<p><b>I love it. What are your thoughts on the state of tech in 2016, both the tech that you considered tech and the tech that a lot of people consider tech?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech is so confusing. What even is the technology industry? Are search engines and camera </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacturers and Crispr therapies and video games really in the same industry? I feel like we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">use “the tech industry” the same way people used to “big business.” What is that thing I hear </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over and over about Uber? “Uber is a taxi company, not a tech company.” Bakers with online </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">delivery are still bakers. Podcasters with an app are still in the business of podcasting. Tech is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just a lazy over simplification of the Bay Area’s $785.5 billion economy that makes it all the more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frustrating for people like me to take my work out into the world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I&#8217;m not an academic and I don&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make a product… I make art to do research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Condensing all these different companies into a thing we call the tech industry does gives us </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">something to blame for the city&#8217;s problems. The industry is refusing to act as proactive stewards </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the place where their employees live. It seems like a lot of money&#8217;s being made and not very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">many taxes are ending up in city coffers. There is clear evidence that private corporate bus lines </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">do increase evictions near their bus stops. Rents are increasing along with poverty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homelessness is intensifying as more people are flooding into the Bay Area chasing after those </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sweet, sweet jobs. Did you know 70% of the homeless population in San Francisco was housed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the last year? Along with all these changes fear mongering about the collapse of San </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francisco&#8217;s weirdo based culture. Most people would say that I&#8217;m being naive, that corporations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have no obligation to nurture the community in which they exist, but if you don&#8217;t do that—if you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">don&#8217;t support the community—then all you&#8217;re doing is going to Southeast Asia and cutting down </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the mangrove forests and planting palm trees so that you can get palm oil. There it looks like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">environmental destruction, here it looks like community destruction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to grow out of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the self centered capitalism that disregards the larger systematic effects until disaster strikes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to take responsibility for that because we&#8217;re not heartless idiots who just stomp around </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world with our big dumb America boots. I don’t want to be that kind of America.</span></p>
<p><b>Man. It is kind of wild to think that big tech is actually necessary for new innovation to survive long term.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yeah, I totally agree but also like big tech is completely dependent on Chinese money, right? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a lot of VC money comes from China and that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m not saying it shouldn&#8217;t come from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China but if that’s going to be true, then you also need to take into consideration the health of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the system of products and money and labor is there too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole system should be healthy, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not just any individual part of it. Why is making as much money as possible still a thing? Who in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their right mind is motivated by I want to make as much money as humanly possible. Why? It&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">boring. Come on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Look I was raised by a woman who taught me that holistic world views were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the only path to true equality, whether that’s in a body or a society, and I hold that as a core </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">value to this day.</span></p>

<p><b>Total side note, but maybe possibly related, I remember reading that you have received death threats for speaking your mind.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yeah [chuckles] yeah, that was a problem. My team and I went to the first Oculus Connect, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and there was an open panel, and it was being live streamed on the internet. And they were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like, &#8221;Anyone could come up and ask a question.&#8221; And there was 1% women at this conference </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and very few people of color and there were no female speakers and I was mad. So I went up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and asked how they planned to prevent the clear race and gender biases of their conference </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the industry as a whole from doing to VR what sexism and racism has done to video g</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ames.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they answered it really poorly. It was so lame. But since I am female and it was live </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">streamed that question turned into doxing, and death threats on 4chan and Reddit. We had to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">get our corporate security officer to intervene. It was scary. I hadn’t expected such an infantile </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">response. I felt so naive. I&#8217;m still super naive, because I still assume that everyone wants </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone to be equal. Also, people who do death threats are so uncreative. I felt like they were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just copy and pasting from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Sarkeesian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anita Sarkeesian</a>&#8216;s death threats.</span></p>
<p><b>I&#8217;m curious, are you able to give no fucks about that or­­…?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t care.</span></p>
<p><b>That&#8217;s good.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah but I have the ability not to care because of my privilege. 1. I&#8217;m white and cisgender and 2. I work for a place that can provide corporate security. Privilege means the death threats are less meaningful to me.</span></p>

<p><b>How do you think tech could be more accommodating right now to a more diverse set of people?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean hire them? I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta-Nehisi_Coates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ta­-Nehisi Coates</a>’s phrase &#8220;People who believe themselves to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">white&#8230;&#8221; so I would say people who believe themselves to be white should maybe consider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">people who do not believe themselves to be white. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People always complain the lack of diversity </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a pipeline issue which is such blame shifting horse shit. If you think of people like crude oil </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who can only reach your factory via a standardized and maintained pipeline then maybe you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shouldn&#8217;t be a company. Or hire people who you perceive to be less qualified. Because your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perceptions of someone&#8217;s lower qualifications are based on your own biases. Go around saying </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that you&#8217;re biased. Be like, &#8221;Hello. I&#8217;m white, and I have white people bias.&#8221; No one is going to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">think that you&#8217;re a horrible, evil person by acknowledging the fact that you&#8217;re biased. Everybody </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is biased, just acknowledge it, and then build systems to make sure that it doesn&#8217;t affect the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">population of your company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Super simple things. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a varied population of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees, go to them and be like, &#8221;Hi. How are we not helping you to do your best work? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please tell me? We are trying to do better.&#8221; Be a person with feelings and failings for fuck sake.</span></p>
<p><b>What advice would you have for someone who wants to do meaningful work in tech, but doesn’t know where to start?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretend like you can accomplish the thing that you want, and write about it as though it were an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inevitability. Write about how the meaningful tech that you want to make is the most important </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thing in your whole life. Read those writings into a camera. Publishing all of it online. Repeat. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking publicly and meaningfully about what it means to use a computer, what it means to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">use your phone, what it means to use stuff that you want to exist in the future will not only hone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your ideas but attract interested bees. Write up design documents for your fake thing. Make </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">drawing of it. Research. Don&#8217;t make a product. Go to the library. Because that&#8217;s what I do. I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">don&#8217;t make a product. I don&#8217;t make technology, really. I make art. I think deeply about the stuff I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make and I write about it in clear ways people can connect with.</span></p>
