    The project has two main goals: to show the outside world a more comprehensive picture of people who work in tech, and to bring a bit of attention to folks in the industry whose stories have never been heard, considered or celebrated.

    <p><b>Let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Tell me about your early years and where you come from.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up in New York city in the upper west side of Manhattan, which is very diverse. My mom is black and my dad is white so I grew up in a mixed-race household and went to a very diverse public school growing up. And so, I had the quite fortunate experience of growing up surrounded by a very brilliant, multicultural set of people for pretty much my entire childhood.</span></p>
<p><b>How do you feel like that&#8217;s shaped you in your work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loved growing up in New York City. There are a lot of points of independence that I took for granted as a kid there. I mean, I was getting myself to and from school and playdates by the time I was 11. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see everything in New York. You see wealth. You see poverty. You see the best and the worst of society. You see people from all backgrounds. You hear every language being spoken on a daily basis. It&#8217;s just such a multicultural upbringing, that I think it really shaped my view of what the world can or should look like.</span></p>
<p><b>I&#8217;m curious to know if you had any inclinations growing up that you would end up in the tech industry. What did you think you were going to be as a kid?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never thought I&#8217;d end up in the tech industry. As a little kid, I thought I wanted to be a pediatrician, because that was like the only job that I understood. But, I never was interested in tech until coming out to Stanford and spending time in Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You see everything in New York. You see wealth. You see poverty. You see the best and the worst of society. You see people from all backgrounds.

<p><b>What was the impetus for that?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like I wanted to go back to school because I wanted to learn how to build a better non-profit. I was kind of just disillusioned with the disconnect between revenues and expenses of the non-profit sector. You&#8217;re always begging for money. So I decided the quickest way to figure out how to be able to do that was to go to grad school. And Stanford, of all the business schools in particular that I visited, seemed to have by far the most diverse student body in terms of professional background and professional address. It was the only place I went where I didn&#8217;t feel like a total freak for trying to do something in the non-profit sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was in Harvard when Zuckerberg started Facebook. There was no (the way there is I think in so many college campuses today) dialogue around entrepreneurship and tech. It was like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s this weird thing that we log into and you can post your photos.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t in my vocabulary until coming to Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me more about your time at Stanford. Obviously what you do now came out of that, but what were your first impressions of Silicon Valley and of Stanford Academia, and this whole kind of new tech world that suddenly you find yourself in?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first impression was that I was horrified because you had to drive a car to get anywhere and I&#8217;d never lived in a place where that was a requirement! I found it very isolating at first.  I was used to being in cities where you walk around and you see the life and the industry. In New York, it&#8217;s obvious how much is going on. You walk out on any street in Silicon Valley and it looks like nothing is happening, which couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth. I became more curious as I had more exposure, but I think the main thing was that the mindset out here was so different than what I was used to. The East Coast tends to be more traditional. People here are always interested in the disruption or the next new thing. If you have an idea, the response is often, &#8221;Go for it. Try it out.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I sat down with Tristan for coffee. We started talking about the fact that, by year 2040, people of color will be the majority in the U.S. He&#8217;d read a book that projected the demise of the middle class as accelerated by the adoption of technology and was in a place of—if this is what&#8217;s at risk, how do we make sure that disenfranchised communities aren&#8217;t further disenfranchised by the adoption and of technology? That was what lead to the impetus for the idea—how do we make the tech sector more inclusive so that people of color—Blacks and Latinos in particular—are not kind of left further on the sidelines further oppressed as our economy rapidly transitions towards a technology-enabled, technology-driven economy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Walk me through the moment of creation of CODE2040.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment of creation came about almost a year after Tristan and I had left Stanford. I did a year of business school and was trying to figure out what to do over the summer, and a friend of a friend was starting a tech company and they had a product that was in soft-mode that they were interested in rolling out across college campuses. I had, in another lifetime started a program on a college campus and had this experience in getting a bunch of shoes galvanized around an idea, and they were like, &#8221;Cool. Just take that and write a roll-out plan for the products.&#8221; It felt like something I could properly figure out. So I went and joined this company for a summer internship with the roll-out plan. I ended up running the product team, which included kind of a segment of the company. But because my background was not in product development when I took over the work, I took an approach of systems and process design that would allow for maximal creative input and use of data. That led me to work very closely with the engineering team, the QA team, the design team. I got a real appreciation of those skillsets. There is a lot of understanding that I did there as well, about engineers’ needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I transitioned myself out of the organization because having a non-technical person running product for a developer facing product did not make sense. I was coming out of that when </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down with Tristan for coffee. We started talking about the fact that, by year 2040, people of color will be the majority in the U.S. He&#8217;d read a book that projected the demise of the middle class as accelerated by the adoption of technology and was in a place of—if this is what&#8217;s at risk, how do we make sure that disenfranchised communities aren&#8217;t further disenfranchised by the adoption and of technology? That was what lead to the impetus for the idea—how do we make the tech sector more inclusive so that people of color—Blacks and Latinos in particular—are not kind of left further on the sidelines further oppressed as our economy rapidly transitions towards a technology-enabled, technology-driven economy. </span></p>
<p><b>What has been the most exciting and activating parts of your work since its creation?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s hard to choose. I think that it&#8217;s been really exciting to see how individuals have been catalyzed by their time with us. They&#8217;re so talented, but a lot of them don&#8217;t have the access to the breadth of opportunities that could really launch them into being leaders in the field. But I think one of the most gratifying pieces of what we do has been working with the tech companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s certainly not true across the board, but there are companies out there who feel like they don&#8217;t know how to do diversity right. To be a place where those companies can go and have that conversation and get resources, that starts initiate systems change.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think the third piece is probably the hardest to quantify or measure, but is about amplifying others. People on Twitter reach out and are say, &#8220;I just want you to know that I am so happy that you are doing this work because I feel less alone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>What have been some of the biggest roadblocks and struggles as an entrepreneur and in building this product?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s been really hard for me to wrap my head around actually being the CEO and what that means in terms of terms of how I act and how people view me. I prefer to empower people around me. To take on as much responsibility as is humanly possible, and probably more than is healthy sometimes. I believe very strongly in distributed responsibility. I believe in a hierarchy, but you push decision making down the chain as much as possible. It&#8217;s really hard for me to remember that people really look to me for a specific level of authority and that my title conveys something, rightly or wrongly about who I am and the level of importance that I hold. I think that has been my struggle that has led me to be really slow to make certain choices or improvements in ways that I think has then made my own job harder.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly not true across the board, but there are companies out there who feel like they don&#8217;t know how to do diversity right. To be a place where those companies can go and have that conversation and get resources, that starts initiate systems change.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><b>What were some roadblocks specifically to launching 2040?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&#8217;ve shifted a lot. Initially the big question was, &#8220;How do we get companies to believe that there is black female talent out there, that is ‘qualified’?” I would say our first inflection point was two years in when enough companies had had terrific experiences with us, that it switched to entirely inbound companies who want to work with us and hire our students. We ended up throttling our growth. That&#8217;s just really hard, period. I don&#8217;t know anybody who can solve that well-—anybody who has made that extremely efficient. I&#8217;d say for the next two years, that was a real throttle for us. How do we solve those operational expansions? We&#8217;re 18 people on staff now but we could have twice as many people and that would be super helpful. But that&#8217;s twice as expensive. Now, it&#8217;s a matter of how do we create a growth plan that&#8217;s really thoughtful and then funded in a way that&#8217;s really thoughtful. Now, it’s the question of how and when do we invest for growth. That&#8217;s the hardest challenge that we&#8217;re facing right now—how do we get the right resources someplace and deploy them as efficiently as possible.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Black and Latina/o students often say, &#8216;Why would I want to go to an industry where I can never advance, and nobody&#8217;s going to value me and I&#8217;m going to feel like an outsider?'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><b>In watching your fellows move through the industry, what have you all learned through your experience about the cultural and behavioral patterns in tech around people of color?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot. We&#8217;ve seen a real and really beneficial shift in the narrative over the last four years. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we started CODE2040, the dominant narrative at the time was that tech is meritocracy. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there aren&#8217;t people of color in the industry, that&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t deserve to be there. We managed to move to a place where people were willing to question that assumption, but still felt like, &#8220;Well, yeah, maybe they deserve to be there, but we can&#8217;t find them. They don&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think people are still trying to figure out what is that other thing that is happening.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A piece of it that we know from working with 75 tech companies and close to 200 students in the fall&#8217;s program alone, is that there is a culture component. It is a combination of a retention issue, and people who opt out. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black and Latina/o students often say, &#8220;Why would I want to go to an industry where I can never advance, and nobody&#8217;s going to value me and I&#8217;m going to feel like an outsider?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s also a growing dialogue now about this false idea of the “hiring bar.” There just is no objective set of standards around hiring. I think what we certainly believe is that there is actually is no good measurement right now. We need to get better at that.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we started CODE2040, the dominant narrative at the time was that tech is meritocracy. If there aren&#8217;t people of color in the industry, that&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t deserve to be there. We managed to move to a place where people were willing to question that assumption, but still felt like, &#8216;Well, yeah, maybe they deserve to be there, but we can&#8217;t find them. They don&#8217;t exist.'&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>What have been your biggest motivators in your work? What at the core drives you?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve always, since I was a kid, had a really strong sense of fairness and justice. It&#8217;s not about who&#8217;s inherently good, bad, right or wrong, but there&#8217;s all these unseen threads that influence how we each act and achieve and show up on a day to day basis. I think that CODE2040 has obviously a strong direct service component. We work directly with students, we&#8217;re not an advocacy organization, but we do all that in service of being able to create larger systems change.</span></p>
<p><b>How do you think your background impacts the way you approach your work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, CODE2040 is this giant code switch for people on both sides. Like how, if you&#8217;re a person of color, you had a certain set of life experiences. How do you show up in a room that looks like a tech company? And if you are a tech company, how do you show up in a way that lets people who just don&#8217;t approach the world the way you approach the world be included and comfortable?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was in enough diverse rooms growing up that I knew it was possible and that it didn&#8217;t have to be weird and uncomfortable. It could be super normal. This whole idea of  discomfort with diversity just never crossed my mind.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Essentially, CODE2040 is this giant code switch for people on both sides. Like how, if you&#8217;re a person of color, you had a certain set of life experiences.

<p><b>How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you? What frustrates you? What would you like to see change?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a lot of ways I&#8217;m way more optimistic than I was a few years back. I think tech has always been good at iterating and learning and failing forward and all of that. It&#8217;s historically been relegated to products and not people and I think we&#8217;re starting to see that ethos move into the people&#8217;s space as well. But there&#8217;s also a big question mark in my mind around—as tech becomes more pervasive across industries and across the country, now what? What does it look like when there&#8217;s a thriving tech sector in Austin? In Durham? All these places that have wildly different backgrounds and backdrops than California, both economically, culturally, ethnically, in terms of industry. I think tech in the future is going to look wildly different than it does today and I don&#8217;t know what it will look like.</span></p>
<p><b>How do you think tech can do a better job accommodating people of color right now?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we need to get serious about doing better on hiring. Treating that as a real competency where people are trained and there&#8217;s more structure around it. It&#8217;s like way too loose right now. So many companies have the intention to be more diverse but don&#8217;t actually have the actions to back it up. Tech undervalues HR. </span></p>
<p>The other piece is recognizing how important culture is and that it&#8217;s really hard to change. You have to seed it at the beginning but it&#8217;s possible to change it if it&#8217;s important to you.</p>
<p><b>What advice would you give to young folks, people of color, who really like tech and want to get into it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find your “tribe.” I find my most effective mentors are my peers, people who have different strengths and skill sets but also people who just have my back and who I can admit my failures to. I think if you&#8217;re in a situation where you&#8217;re not around your network, crafting a professional one can go a long way to making it feel like a more welcoming and exciting place.</span></p>
