    We cover subjects who tend to be underrepresented in the greater tech narrative. This includes (but is not limited to) women, people of color, folks over 50, LGBT, working parents, disabled, etc.
    
    The project has two main goals: to show the outside world a more comprehensive picture of people who work in tech, and to bring a bit of attention to folks in the industry whose stories have never been heard, considered or celebrated. We believe storytelling is a powerful tool for social impact and positive change." />

    <p><b>Well first I want to know where you were born, and your early years, and where you come from.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up in a multicultural working class community, consisting mostly of immigrant families, right outside of Boston, Massachusetts. It wasn’t the safest or nicest neighborhood, but for my parents it was a step up from the situation back home on the Cape Verde Islands.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love it when people tell me I can&#8217;t do something and then proving them wrong. I get a kick out of that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After the birth of my youngest brother, my mother made two key decisions that would significantly impact our lives and futures. First, she decided to move her family from a troubled neighborhood in Boston to a much safer community. And second; she sent us to a private Catholic school in said community. These events limited our exposure to drugs and gang violence, and got us access to quality education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My high school was funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to supports its innovative model where students would attend regular classes for four days. The fifth day was reserved for a full time job shared amongst five students. We learned valuable, real life skills and could put away the earnings towards our tuition. This is where I was exposed to technology for the first time. I worked with engineers and was quickly captivated by all its potential.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of my biggest insecurities is language. English is not my first language, and because of that, I don&#8217;t feel like I have the vocabulary to be as persuasive as I&#8217;d like to be. Immigrant parents combined with marginalized, low-quality education doesn’t really build a ton self-confidence. &#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the proximity of universities like Harvard, MIT, and Tufts to my home, I never really thought about college until my cousin invited me to spend a weekend with her at Boston College. That experience was transformative for me because suddenly college felt like an obtainable goal. If my cousin could make it, so could I.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My college experience was, like it is for many people who look like me, very challenging. I had to balance lectures and exams with jobs, but that’s how I ended up working for Karmaloop. And at Karmaloop I got exposed to design, art, streetwear brands, marketing – brands like Supreme and Married to the Mob – all of which had strong foundations in graphic design. After I got my degree in neuroscience, I decided to do something for myself. I bought a one way ticket to San Francisco and left everything behind. In San Francisco I found design, technology, art, and myself.  For the first three years I worked as a user research lead for a startup that allowed me to travel all over the world. I got exposed to the long hours and high pressure of tech, but was able to tap deeply into my passion for design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I worked in tech as interaction designer for a few years now. Those years gave me enough insights into the treatment of women. But one of my biggest issues with the whole diversity conversation is that is it’s often too much conversation. As a designer, I wanted to build and test something that could actually be shipped.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I fondly remember Ben Horowitz telling me, &#8216;There&#8217;s offense, and there’s defense. And what you&#8217;re telling me right now is that you&#8217;re taking people of color, who are naturally creative. People of color invented hip-hop, jazz, blues, and rock ‘n’ roll, and you&#8217;re putting them in an arena where they&#8217;re positioned to win. I think it&#8217;s a great idea. Let&#8217;s go tell Kanye about it.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quit my job in early 2015 and founded Front &amp; Center. I wanted to expose creative young adults from underrepresented communities to non-engineering roles in tech. I researched and worked with design leaders from Facebook, Google, KPCB, Vice and many others to define a basic set of required skills for product designers that don’t pursue a traditional academic path. That research resulted in a design training program consisting of basic design, communication and presentation skills. Today, I mostly mentor through Front &amp; Center, consult as a designer. </span></p>
<p><b>  What has your experience been building Front &amp; Center?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m very lucky because my partner has been an entrepreneur for years; he helped me out by coaching me on how to avoid typical first time founder mistakes. But even with his help, there is a lot of falling on my face. I saw a problem, but had no solution. So I started building what I thought was right, but while speaking with investors I figured out it’s very hard to find a model for something that usually fits within the non-profit mold. So I had to do a lot of catching up on how to run an actual business, so I wouldn&#8217;t look like a fool. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And one of my biggest insecurities is language. English is not my first language, and because of that, I don&#8217;t feel like I have the vocabulary to be as persuasive as I&#8217;d like to be. Immigrant parents combined with marginalized, low-quality education doesn’t really build a ton self-confidence. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know when they say, &#8216;just fake it till you make it,&#8217; right? Well–it’s super hard for me to fake anything because I have no reference points. Getting help from someone that’s gone through similar hurdles is practically impossible because there are very few people who look like me that do what I do.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding people you can look up to and model your progress after is so important to individual development. Even today I struggle to find role models. There are very few successful black women who made it as designers.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been able to expand my network with some amazing people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I fondly remember Ben Horowitz telling me, &#8220;There&#8217;s offense, and there’s defense. And what you&#8217;re telling me right now is that you&#8217;re taking people of color, who are naturally creative. People of color invented hip-hop, jazz, blues, and rock ‘n’ roll, and you&#8217;re putting them in an arena where they&#8217;re positioned to win. I think it&#8217;s a great idea. Let&#8217;s go tell Kanye about it.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Now these kinds of things happen in Silicon Valley, but all I could think of was “Oh my god, I get to meet Kanye West.” Moments like these don’t come often when you’re a founder. They definitely don’t come when you’re a founder from a marginalized community. But moments like these keep you going, wherever you’re from as a founder.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me more about just the struggles you&#8217;ve overall had in your time of tech. What are the roadblocks you&#8217;ve had to overcome?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know when they say, “just fake it till you make it”, right? Well – it’s super hard for me to fake anything because I have no reference points. Getting help from someone that’s gone through similar hurdles is practically impossible because there are very few people who look like me that do what I do.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding people you can look up to and model your progress after is so important to individual development. Even today I struggle to find role models. There are very few successful black women who made it as designers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So you have to look beyond your appearance, One person that has inspired my way of thinking about the world is Elle Luna. She’s a person that lives her truth, and I’m thankful to have learned that it’s enough to be inspired. Having role models that look like you is great. But when there aren’t any out there, you need to learn to look up to individuals that don’t necessarily look like you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t stress enough how important role models are. And I want to be that role model for the community that I’m from.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When I hear celebrities say, “I’m not a role model, I’m an artist, I can do whatever I want”, I say no: You’re one of the few that made it out. You can show others how to do that. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passing on information is so important to break the cycles of division and separation. I’m in a unique position to set the example for future generations.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been thinking a lot about tech-debt in communities of color lately. Access to technology in communities like the one I’m from is incomparable to the access to technology that most people who become successful in Silicon Valley have. Most Black schools have pretty abysmal computer science labs. Students don’t have computers at home, let alone an internet connection. So next to figuring out what stock options mean, a lot of people who are trying to break into technology need to catch up on people who’ve been exposed to tech for much, much longer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I had the privilege to get my first personal computer when I was 14 years old. And I didn&#8217;t really know what code was until I was 19. But most of my peers in tech have had access to technology for all their lives, and role models that encouraged them to explore. For people who come from communities like mine, a career in tech is like a pipe dream. There is nobody around you who’s made it in tech, and no parents of family members who can tell you about the career opportunities. Sure, leadership skills come somewhat naturally, but communication can be a challenge when you haven’t been exposed to tech culture like so many of the people around me have.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve been thinking a lot about tech-debt in communities of color lately. Access to technology in communities like the one I’m from is incomparable to the access to technology that most people who become successful in Silicon Valley have.

So next to figuring out what stock options mean, a lot of people who are trying to break into technology need to catch up on people who’ve been exposed to tech for much, much longer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><b>How do you think your background in behavioral science helps you in your work? Both as a product designer and as an entrepreneur.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an academic background has mostly triggered a thirst to keep learning. I like watching things and studying their patterns, which is another side to this inclusion discussion that I find remarkable. When people stop learning and stop questioning the way the world works around them, things like bias, discrimination and racism come into play. I’ve been trying to fix that conversation by prototyping solutions that can actually be implemented, and found that in order to work in tech – an academic path is very beneficial but in most cases, not an absolute necessity. Especially in the field of design. </span></p>
<p><b>What would you say are your big motivators?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love it when people tell me I can&#8217;t do something and then proving them wrong. I get a kick out of that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I decided to speak out more because I want kids to know how to deal with similar situations. I want them to say, &#8220;I want to be like Melanie when I grow up.&#8221; I didn’t have anyone I could be like growing up. So I collected all this advice; some of it I can use, some of it I can’t. Bits and pieces of people that have inspired me along the way, and I try to keep improving myself like that.</span></p>
<p><b>Okay, let&#8217;s just go macro real quick. How do you feel about the state of tech in 2016? What excites you, what frustrates you, and what would you like to see change?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m most excited about  companies that exist to do good and challenge the way we think about the world, so I&#8217;m really in love with Honor. I love what they&#8217;re doing, I love the problem that they&#8217;re solving. It&#8217;s really exciting because it&#8217;s a human problem and everyone benefits from it. The workforce, the families, even the way they run the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The things that frustrate me? There are still too many non-problems being solved. Things that are only accessible by a very controlled, homogenous audience. I’m worried about the accessibility of technology. Many processes continue to optimize and drive down prices, making things more affordable – but there very few processes that focus on making life more enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><b>What advice would you have for folks coming from similar backgrounds as yours who are hoping to get into tech?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need that hustle. A strong will to succeed because you will hear “no” more often than people will tell you “yes.” Shit will get hard. But if it’d be easy, anybody would be doing it. We experience racism and other difficulties every single day. Use that sadness and anger to lift yourself up in the right direction. If people don’t believe you, build whatever you can and try to prove them wrong.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With Front &amp; Center I’ve tried to hack a system that I found didn’t make sense. So I decided to make a change. I measure my success by the opportunities I create for other people. I want people to join me in designing a more inclusive future. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You need that hustle. A strong will to succeed because you will hear “no” more often than people will tell you &#8216;yes.&#8217; Shit will get hard. But if it’d be easy, anybody would be doing it. We experience racism and other difficulties every single day. Use that sadness and anger to lift yourself up in the right direction. If people don’t believe you, build whatever you can and try to prove them wrong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
